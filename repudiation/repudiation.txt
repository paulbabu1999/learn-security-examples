- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


Vulnerability: Repudiation occurs when users deny actions, causing disputes. Insecure systems lack comprehensive logging.

Secure Solution: Robust logging records all user activities, establishing an audit trail that prevents users from denying their actions.

Additional Security Mechanisms:

Two-Factor Authentication
Immutable Logs
