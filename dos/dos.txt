- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


DoS Attack Vulnerability:
Without a try-catch mechanism, a system is vulnerable to crashing when errors occur, making it susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by overwhelming it with illegitimate traffic.

Secure Version:
Incorporates try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully, preventing crashes and maintaining system stability even when errors occur, thus mitigating the risk of DoS attacks.

Additional Security Measures:

Rate Limiting
DDoS Protection
